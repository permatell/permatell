# $HOOD Fair Launch Twitter Thread

1/
The PermaTell $HOOD token fair launch is now live! You can allocate your AO yield to our ecosystem project and receive $HOOD tokens in return.

Here's everything you need to know about $HOOD: its supply, rewards, and how the fair launch works. üßµ‚¨áÔ∏è

2/
$HOOD is the native token of the PermaTell ecosystem with a fixed supply of 21,000,000 tokens. The token is allocated as follows:

- 70% to the PI Fair Launch
- 20% for community growth (4% for Goddesses NFT holders, 16% for public contributors)
- 10% for platform sustainability

No additional $HOOD will be minted beyond this allocation.

3/
The Fair Launch distribution ensures that 70% of all $HOOD tokens (14.7M tokens) will be distributed to community members who delegate their AO yield to the PermaTell project.

This community-first approach ensures fair distribution with no pre-sales or insider allocations.

4/
$HOOD follows a carefully designed emission schedule:
- 17% of fair launch supply minted in year 1
- Gradual decrease years 2-4
- First halving at year 5
- Subsequent halvings every 4 years

This ensures early participants are rewarded while maintaining long-term value.
