# $HOOD Token Breakdown

## Overview

$HOOD is the native token of the PermaTell ecosystem, designed to incentivize and reward participation in the decentralized storytelling platform. With a fixed total supply of 21,000,000 $HOOD tokens, the fair launch distribution ensures a transparent and community-focused allocation while supporting long-term platform sustainability.

For the Permaweb Index (PI) Fair Launch, the total supply is divided into three main allocations:

- **70%** (14,700,000 $HOOD) allocated to the PI Fair Launch via AO yield delegation
- **20%** (4,200,000 $HOOD) reserved for community growth and ecosystem development:
  - **4%** (840,000 $HOOD) specifically for Goddesses atomic assets holders
  - **16%** (3,360,000 $HOOD) for public users creating and contributing to stories
- **10%** (2,100,000 $HOOD) allocated for future platform sustainability and developer incentives

## Effective Reward Pool

The effective reward pool consists of the 70% allocation (14,700,000 $HOOD) dedicated to the PI Fair Launch. This pool will be distributed to participants who delegate their AO yield to the PermaTell ecosystem project.

## Goddesses NFT Holder Benefits

Holders of the Goddesses atomic assets collection receive special benefits:
- Dedicated allocation of 840,000 $HOOD tokens (4% of total supply)
- Enhanced rewards for creating stories and contributing to the platform
- Must connect wallet to PermaTell and verify ownership to receive benefits
- Earn $HOOD tokens for writing stories and contributing to other stories

## Emission Schedule

$HOOD follows a time-based emission schedule designed to reward early participants while ensuring long-term sustainability:

- **Initial year**: 17% of the total fair launch supply will be minted
- **Years 2-4**: Gradual decrease in emission rate
- **Year 5**: First halving event, reducing emission rate by 50%
- **Subsequent halvings**: Every 4 years (Years 9, 13, etc.)

### Daily Rewards Calculation

Daily rewards are calculated based on:
1. The current position in the emission schedule
2. Total amount of AO yield allocated to the PermaTell project
3. Individual user's allocation percentage

The allocation is designed to ensure that early participants receive higher rewards, with a gradual decrease over time to support long-term token value stability.

## Dynamic Distribution

$HOOD tokens are distributed daily to users based on their AO yield allocation:
- Users allocate a percentage (minimum 5%) of their AO yield to earn $HOOD tokens
- The allocation can be adjusted or removed at any time
- The amount of $HOOD received is proportional to the percentage of AO yield allocated
